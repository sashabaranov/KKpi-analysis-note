\section{Selection}
This is a very crucial section. We would like to 
see the selection clearly described, and possibly 
a set of distributions of the variables 
used in the selection, in data and MC.
If you like, you can also add comparisons Mag Down vs. 
Mag Up and 2011 vs. 2012 data.
These checks are welcome but not required.
