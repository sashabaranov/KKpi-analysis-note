\section{Efficiencies}
% It is nice to add here the method you use to 
% estimate the efficiency, and at least a plot of the 
% efficiency(ies) itself.

The overall efficiency is the product of the generator level efficiency ($\epsilon^{gen\&acc}$) which includes the geometrical acceptance of the detector and generator level cuts efficiency, the combined reconstruction and selection efficiency ($\epsilon^{rec\&sel}$) and the trigger efficiency ($\epsilon^{trig}$). For first approach we are using $\epsilon^{full} = \epsilon^{rec\&sel} \times \epsilon^{trig}$.


\subsection{Acceptance efficiency}
Obtained individual generator level efficiencies for signal and normalization channels is presented in the table below:

Year & Magnet & $B_{u} \to J/\psi KK\pi$ & $B_{u} \to \psi' K$ \\
\hline
2011 & Up   & $0.15678 \pm 0.00041$ & $0.15311 \pm 0.00039$ \\
2011 & Down & $0.15713 \pm 0.00039$ & $0.15390 \pm 0.00039$ \\
2012 & Up   & $0.16175 \pm 0.00060$ & $0.1559  \pm 0.000393$ \\
2012 & Down & $0.1609  \pm 0.0013$  & $0.1562  \pm 0.000391$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The average of four ratios is $1.028 \pm 0.003$ is chosen as the resulting ratio of geometrical acceptance efficiencies (uncertainty is statistical only). The maximal devistion from the average is taken as systematic uncertainty and equals $1\%$.
